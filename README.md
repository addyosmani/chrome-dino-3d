## About

This is a 3D reimagining of Chrome's offline dinosaur game - that addictive little game you see when Chrome can't connect to the internet. The original game was created by Chrome's "Chrome UX" team members Edward Jung, Sebastien Gabriel and Alan Bettes in 2014, and has since become a beloved easter egg played by millions during internet outages.

While the original features charming pixel art in 2D, this version brings the T-Rex into the world of 3D while staying true to the original's aesthetic. All graphics were hand-crafted using Magica Voxel to maintain the game's iconic minimalist style.
